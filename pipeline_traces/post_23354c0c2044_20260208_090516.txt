 STEP 1: COLOR DERIVATION
================================================================================

Input hex: #98c837

{
  "hex": "#98c837",
  "hue_category": "cool_green",
  "saturation": 0.569,
  "lightness": 0.5
}

================================================================================
 STEP 2: IMAGE ANALYSIS (OpenAI Vision → gpt-5.2)
================================================================================

Input: user-uploaded image (binary)

Output (ImageAnalysis):
{
  "scene_description": "A close, front-facing portrait fills the frame: a person sits under a grid of office ceiling tiles, their hand covering their mouth in a quiet, inward pause. Cool, flat fluorescent light washes the skin and softens shadows, while the background recedes into a muted gray wall and dark vent slats, giving the space a shallow, boxed-in depth.",
  "detected_objects": [
    "person",
    "hand covering mouth",
    "collared shirt (dusty mauve fabric)",
    "dark undershirt",
    "drop ceiling tiles",
    "fluorescent light fixture",
    "ceiling vent/grille",
    "plain wall"
  ],
  "vibe": "cool fluorescent stillness, muted institutional hush, soft-grain intimacy, slightly airless quiet",
  "emotion": "pensive self-containment with a thread of tired uncertainty",
  "dominant_colors": [
    "cool gray-white ceiling",
    "dusty mauve/pink shirt",
    "soft beige skin tones",
    "charcoal vent slats",
    "muted slate-gray wall"
  ],
  "environment": "indoor",
  "time_of_day": "null",
  "location_hint": "a quiet office or classroom-like room with fluorescent ceiling panels",
  "ambient_sound_associations": [
    "fluorescent light ballast hum",
    "faint HVAC airflow through a ceiling vent",
    "soft fabric rustle from a sleeve shifting",
    "subtle breath through the nose behind a hand",
    "distant muffled footsteps in a corridor",
    "a chair\u2019s barely-audible creak under a small weight shift",
    "occasional building settling tick from the ceiling grid"
  ],
  "sonic_metaphor": "A thin fluorescent hum stretched into a held note, with a heartbeat-like thud buried under layers of quiet air."

 STEP 3: SQUIGGLE FEATURE EXTRACTION
================================================================================

Output (SquiggleFeatures):
{
  "total_length": 0.00063,
  "bounding_box_area": 0.0,
  "average_speed": 0.00063,
  "speed_variance": 0.0,
  "point_count": 2
}

================================================================================
 STEP 4: IMAGE ENHANCEMENT PROMPT (OpenAI → gpt-5.2)
================================================================================

Input: ImageAnalysis + ColorInput + SquiggleFeatures

Output (ImageEnhancementPrompt):
{
  "emotional_intent": "Transform the pensive self-containment into a calm, oxygen-rich moment of quiet resolve, as if the room finally exhales with them.",
  "visual_directive": "Grade the image toward cool-green (#98c837) undertones with softened contrast, gentle bloom around the fluorescent light, and a subtle atmospheric veil to reduce the institutional harshness.",
  "morphing_prompt": "Preserve the exact portrait and composition, but let a cool-green, organic tint seep into the midtones and shadows, turning the fluorescent flatness into a calmer, more breathable hush. Soften edges and micro-contrast on skin and ceiling tiles, add a faint film-grain texture, and introduce a delicate haze that makes the background feel less boxed-in while keeping all objects unchanged. Shape the light so highlights roll off smoothly with a mild glow, and add a restrained vignette to pull the viewer into the subject\u2019s inward pause without increasing drama.",
  "style_reference": "Sofia Coppola quiet minimalism with subtle contemporary film grain"
}

================================================================================
 STEP 5: IMAGE MORPHING (OpenAI → gpt-image-1)
================================================================================

Input image: original + color overlay (Pillow)
Prompt sent to gpt-image-1:

  "Preserve the exact portrait and composition, but let a cool-green, organic tint seep into the midtones and shadows, turning the fluorescent flatness into a calmer, more breathable hush. Soften edges and micro-contrast on skin and ceiling tiles, add a faint film-grain texture, and introduce a delicate haze that makes the background feel less boxed-in while keeping all objects unchanged. Shape the light so highlights roll off smoothly with a mild glow, and add a restrained vignette to pull the viewer into the subject’s inward pause without increasing drama."
