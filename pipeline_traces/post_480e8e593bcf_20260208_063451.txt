 STEP 1: COLOR DERIVATION
================================================================================

Input hex: #99666f

  "saturation": 0.2,
  "lightness": 0.5

 STEP 2: IMAGE ANALYSIS (OpenAI Vision → gpt-5.2)
================================================================================

Input: user-uploaded image (binary)

Output (ImageAnalysis):
{
  "scene_description": "A dim, fluorescent-lit office corner recedes into a soft gray background, with a drop-ceiling grid and a long ventilation strip drawing the eye into depth. In the foreground, a person leans into frame, arms raised in a playful V-sign gesture, their face softly blurred by low light and camera noise. The space feels sparse and echo-prone, with hard surfaces (tile ceiling, painted walls, laminate table) catching a cold, flat sheen.",
  "detected_objects": [
    "drop ceiling tiles",
    "ceiling ventilation grille",
    "white painted walls",
    "laminate table surface",

  "dominant_colors": [
    "cool office white",
    "soft concrete gray",
    "muted olive-brown fabric",
    "charcoal shadow tones",
    "pale beige skin tones"
  ],
  "environment": "indoor",
  "time_of_day": "night",
  "location_hint": "a quiet office break area or classroom-like workspace with a table and ceiling vents",
  "ambient_sound_associations": [
    "fluorescent light ballast buzz",
    "HVAC vent whisper and occasional rattle",
    "ceramic mug clink against a tabletop",
    "distant chair legs scraping on linoleum",
    "soft phone vibration or notification ping from another room",
    "faint keyboard tapping echoing down the hall",
    "a bottle cap twisting and plastic crinkling"
  ],
  "sonic_metaphor": "A thin neon hum under a muffled laugh\u2014like a cassette recording of a midnight break, slightly warped at the edges."

 STEP 3: SQUIGGLE FEATURE EXTRACTION
================================================================================

Output (SquiggleFeatures):

  "point_count": 31
}

================================================================================
 STEP 4: IMAGE ENHANCEMENT PROMPT (OpenAI → gpt-5.2)
================================================================================

Input: ImageAnalysis + ColorInput + SquiggleFeatures

Output (ImageEnhancementPrompt):
{
  "emotional_intent": "Turn the tired late-shift camaraderie into a muted, defiant after-hours warmth\u2014like a private joke glowing under sterile lights.",
  "visual_directive": "Grade the scene toward low-saturation warm red/mauve undertones (#99666f), keeping the fluorescent chill in the highlights while deepening shadows with a soft, cinematic haze.",
  "morphing_prompt": "Preserve the exact office corner and the person\u2019s V-sign pose, but shift the mood into a midnight break-room reverie: cool fluorescent whites become slightly green-cyan in the brightest areas while midtones and shadows bloom with a dusty mauve warmth. Add gentle film grain and subtle halation around ceiling lights and reflective surfaces, with a faint vignette that pulls focus toward the foreground figure without sharpening their blur. Enhance texture in the ceiling grid and ventilation strip with soft contrast, and introduce a thin atmospheric veil that makes the depth feel quieter, more intimate, and a little rebellious.",
  "style_reference": "Sofia Coppola\u2019s quiet nocturnal minimalism with subtle 35mm film grain"
}

================================================================================
 STEP 5: IMAGE MORPHING (OpenAI → gpt-image-1)
================================================================================

Input image: original + color overlay (Pillow)
Prompt sent to gpt-image-1:

  "Preserve the exact office corner and the person’s V-sign pose, but shift the mood into a midnight break-room reverie: cool fluorescent whites become slightly green-cyan in the brightest areas while midtones and shadows bloom with a dusty mauve warmth.

================================================================================

Input: AudioStructuredObject + ColorInput + ImageAnalysis + SquiggleFeatures

Output (prompt string sent to ElevenLabs):

  "Instrumental music track. Genre: lo-fi downtempo. Scene: A dim, fluorescent-lit office corner recedes into a soft gray background, with a drop-ceiling grid and a long ventilation strip drawing the eye into depth. In the foreground, a person leans into frame, arms raised in a playful V-sign gesture, their face softly blurred by low light and camera noise. The space feels sparse and echo-prone, with hard surfaces (tile ceiling, painted walls, laminate table) catching a cold, flat sheen.. Vibe: fluorescent-dry, grainy-cool, late-shift hush, playful intrusion. Setting: night indoor. Sounds like: A thin neon hum under a muffled laugh—like a cassette recording of a midnight break, slightly warped at the edges.. Quietly building, weary and mischievous mood with a warm and bold, subdued tonal palette, tape-warp wobble, fluorescent-hum drone bed, soft lo-fi grit, dry room reverb tails textures, and sustained pads and slow drones with focused simplicity. Instruments: Rhodes piano, analog synth pad, sub bass, rim-click drum machine. Timbre: cassette-warmed, grainy and cool with a muted warm-red tint; slightly warped at the edges. Harmonic feel: suspended and slightly bittersweet. Dynamic shape: gentle fade-in on neon hum, a small rhythmic pulse enters halfway, then dissolves back into hiss. Drawing from: fluorescent light ballast buzz, HVAC vent whisper with occasional rattle, ceramic mug clink on laminate, distant chair scrape on linoleum, faint notification ping. 78 BPM, in A minor, slow tempo, sparse density, 15 seconds long. Instrumental only, no vocals, no lyrics."
