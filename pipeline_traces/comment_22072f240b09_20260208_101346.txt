================================================================================

Input: AudioStructuredObject + ColorInput + ImageAnalysis + SquiggleFeatures

Output (prompt string sent to ElevenLabs):

  "Instrumental music track. Genre: minimal nu-jazz / downtempo. Scene: A close, slightly tilted indoor snapshot catches a person leaning toward the camera in a soft gray hoodie, their face lit by cool, diffuse overhead light. The shallow depth and tight framing make the foreground feel intimate and immediate, while the background recedes into muted classroom-like geometry—tables, a pale ceiling grid, and a quiet corner of objects.. Vibe: cool fluorescent hush, soft-fabric closeness, matte gray calm, candid off-angle intimacy. Setting: null indoor. Sounds like: Like a close-mic’d whisper wrapped in fleece, floating under a steady fluorescent drone.. Driving and pulsing, intimate and curious mood with a organic and verdant, vivid tonal palette, close-mic breathy lead fragments, soft fabric-foley swishes as micro-percussion, steady fluorescent-hum drone bed, tight, dry room reverb with occasional gated tails textures, and sustained pads and slow drones with focused simplicity. Instruments: Rhodes piano, vibraphone, 808 rimshot, sub bass synth. Timbre: cool, clean fluorescent sheen with organic foley detail and a neon-green sparkle on the highs. Harmonic feel: suspended and slightly shy, resolving in small half-steps. Dynamic shape: soft fade-in on drone, groove clicks in, brief mid-clip lift with brighter hits, then quick hush-out. Drawing from: low fluorescent light hum, hoodie fabric rustle, pen tapping on laminate, distant muffled hallway voices. Make it musically engaging with clear rhythm and forward momentum. 124 BPM, in D minor, medium tempo, sparse density, 18 seconds long. Instrumental only, no vocals, no lyrics."
