 STEP 5: COMPILED PROMPT (deterministic logic)
================================================================================

Input: AudioStructuredObject + ColorInput + ImageAnalysis + SquiggleFeatures

Output (prompt string sent to ElevenLabs):

  "Instrumental ambient track. Genre: minimal downtempo. Scene: An extreme close-up selfie fills the frame with a face caught mid-gasp, eyes wide and mouth open, as if a sudden realization hit like a flashbulb. Cool, flat overhead office lighting bounces off pale walls and a grid ceiling, compressing the space into a shallow, claustrophobic depth where the background dissolves into fluorescent hush.. Vibe: fluorescent-stung immediacy, close-quarters claustrophobia, jittery high-contrast alertness, dry office-air sterility. Setting: null indoor. Sounds like: A sudden inhale that snaps into fluorescent buzz—like a jump-cut in a quiet office where the air itself clicks to attention.. Building momentum, restless and fatigued mood with a warm and earthy, vivid tonal palette, thin fluorescent buzz layer, soft pulsing sub, minimal click-percussion, hushed, looping pad textures, and sustained pads and slow drones with focused simplicity. Instruments: glassy FM electric piano, soft analog synth pad, sub bass sine, tight rim-click percussion. Timbre: cool violet-tinted digital haze with subtle metallic transients, clean and slightly sterile. Harmonic feel: suspended and slightly anxious. Dynamic shape: steady loop with a faint swell midway, then a gentle fade. Drawing from: overhead fluorescent light buzz, laptop fan whir, aluminum can tick/tap, cable rub across tabletop, distant muffled hallway footsteps. Make it musically engaging with clear rhythm and forward momentum. 74 BPM, in D minor, slow tempo, sparse density, 15 seconds long. Instrumental only, no vocals, no lyrics."
