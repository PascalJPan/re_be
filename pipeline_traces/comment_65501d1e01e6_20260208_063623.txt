Input: AudioStructuredObject + ColorInput + ImageAnalysis + SquiggleFeatures

Output (prompt string sent to ElevenLabs):

  "Instrumental music track. Genre: lo-fi downtempo. Scene: A fluorescent-lit office corner stretches back in cool, flat light, with a grid ceiling and long vent lines pulling the eye into depth. In the foreground, a person leans into the frame with wide eyes and a startled expression, while a cluttered table and blank whiteboard sit softly out of focus behind. The air feels dry and quiet, like a room paused between meetings.. Vibe: fluorescent-dry stillness, beige institutional hush, slightly grainy webcam immediacy, cool sterile spaciousness. Setting: null indoor. Sounds like: A sudden clarinet squeak cutting through a long, low air-conditioner drone in a room that’s trying very hard to stay quiet.. Quietly building, awkward and playful mood with a organic and verdant, vivid tonal palette, fluorescent-hum drone bed, tight gated micro-percussion, glitchy stutter edits, dry close-mic transients, subtle lo-fi grit textures, and sustained pads and slow drones. Instruments: Rhodes piano, bass clarinet (squeak accents), analog synth pad, rim-click drum machine. Timbre: cool sterile-green sheen over cassette-warm grain; dry and close with occasional glitch flicker. Harmonic feel: suspended with a comic, slightly tense edge. Dynamic shape: steady neon drone, then a brief clarinet squeak motif and busier rim-click grid bloom in the middle, settling back to the hum. Drawing from: fluorescent light ballast buzz, HVAC vent whoosh with occasional rattle, paper cup tap on tabletop, muffled hallway footsteps on carpet, faint door latch click. 78 BPM, in A minor, slow tempo, dense density, 15 seconds long. Instrumental only, no vocals, no lyrics."
