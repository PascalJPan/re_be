 STEP 2: IMAGE ANALYSIS (OpenAI Vision → gpt-5.2)
================================================================================

Input: user-uploaded image (binary)

Output (ImageAnalysis):
{
  "scene_description": "A soft, out-of-focus field of deep reddish-brown fills the frame, like light filtered through skin or a fabric held too close to the lens. The illumination is diffuse and velvety, with gentle gradients that suggest shallow depth and no distinct horizon\u2014just a warm, enveloping haze.",
  "detected_objects": [
    "blurred reddish surface",
    "diffuse light gradient",
    "possible skin or fabric texture",
    "camera lens softness/no focal detail"
  ],
  "vibe": "velvet-muffled heat, close-pressed opacity, ember-dim softness, cocooned claustrophobia",
  "emotion": "drowsy disorientation with a private, slightly uneasy intimacy",
  "dominant_colors": [
    "burnt sienna haze",
    "deep brick red",

}

================================================================================
 STEP 4: IMAGE ENHANCEMENT PROMPT (OpenAI → gpt-5.2)
================================================================================

Input: ImageAnalysis + ColorInput + SquiggleFeatures

Output (ImageEnhancementPrompt):
{
  "emotional_intent": "Shatter the velvety intimacy into a fractured dreamscape of glowing chaos and subtle anguish.",
  "visual_directive": "Dissolve the scene into a hyper-stylized glitching mosaic with explosive color fragments and painterly distortions.",
  "morphing_prompt": "Transform the soft, out-of-focus reddish surface into a surreal, fragmented collage of thick, swirling brush strokes and jagged glitch shards. Overlay saturated magenta and maroon hues in a chaotic, high-contrast palette, integrating halftone patterns and burnished textures reminiscent of a distorted oil painting. Emphasize the dreamy haze with exaggerated painterly smudges and introduce digital noise to craft an intense, tumultuous visual storm that keeps the subject partially recognizable amidst the chaos.",
  "style_reference": "Abstract Expressionist oil painting combined with glitch art and cyberpunk digital distortion"
}

================================================================================
 STEP 5: IMAGE MORPHING (OpenAI → gpt-image-1)
================================================================================

Input image: original + color overlay (Pillow)
Prompt sent to gpt-image-1:

  "Transform the soft, out-of-focus reddish surface into a surreal, fragmented collage of thick, swirling brush strokes and jagged glitch shards. Overlay saturated magenta and maroon hues in a chaotic, high-contrast palette, integrating halftone patterns and burnished textures reminiscent of a distorted oil painting. Emphasize the dreamy haze with exaggerated painterly smudges and introduce digital noise to craft an intense, tumultuous visual storm that keeps the subject partially recognizable amidst the chaos."

Output: morphed image bytes (stored as post image) — SUCCESS

 STEP 7: COMPILED PROMPT (deterministic logic)
================================================================================

Input: AudioStructuredObject + ColorInput + ImageAnalysis + SquiggleFeatures

Output (prompt string sent to ElevenLabs):

  "Instrumental ambient track. Genre: ambient. Scene: A soft, out-of-focus field of deep reddish-brown fills the frame, like light filtered through skin or a fabric held too close to the lens. The illumination is diffuse and velvety, with gentle gradients that suggest shallow depth and no distinct horizon—just a warm, enveloping haze.. Vibe: velvet-muffled heat, close-pressed opacity, ember-dim softness, cocooned claustrophobia. Setting: null abstract. Sounds like: A low, warm drone wrapped in felt, as if a heartbeat were playing through a closed fist.. Building momentum, intimate and disorienting mood with a warm and lush tonal palette, velvety, damped high frequencies, soft fabric-like textures, and sustained pads and slow drones with focused simplicity. Instruments: warm drone synth, felt-like pad, subtle field recordings. Timbre: warm, soft, muffled, organic. Harmonic feel: suspended. Dynamic shape: slow, steady drone with minimal fluctuation. Drawing from: muffled room tone, heartbeat thump, subtle creaks, distant hum. Make it musically engaging with clear rhythm and forward momentum. 90 BPM, in A minor, slow tempo, sparse density, 18 seconds long. Instrumental only, no vocals, no lyrics."
