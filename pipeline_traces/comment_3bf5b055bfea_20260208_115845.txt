Input: AudioStructuredObject + ColorInput + ImageAnalysis + SquiggleFeatures

Output (prompt string sent to ElevenLabs):

  "Instrumental music track. Genre: hyperpop. Scene: A close, wide-angle selfie captures two young men in a fluorescent-lit office, their faces bright with exaggerated grins and thumbs-up gestures. The drop-ceiling grid and long light fixture recede overhead, giving the room a shallow, echoing depth with cool, flat illumination and soft webcam grain.. Vibe: fluorescent-crisp cheer, webcam-grainy immediacy, plasticky office stillness, caffeinated buoyancy. Setting: afternoon indoor. Sounds like: A bright, staccato synth chord snapped on under fluorescent hum—like a grin you can hear.. Explosively energetic, playful and restlessly focused mood with a organic and verdant tonal palette, staccato, clicky, glossy-synthetic, tight-gated, layered arpeggios, micro-percussive textures, and sustained pads and slow drones with focused simplicity. Instruments: bright analog synth arpeggiator, FM pluck lead, 808 kick, tight clap/snare. Timbre: neon-clean digital brightness with papery clicks, short room reverb, and crisp transient focus. Harmonic feel: sparkly and resolving with quick, curious turnarounds. Dynamic shape: quick drop-in, steady forward push with small rhythmic fills, final bar filter-lift then hard stop. Drawing from: sticky note edge peel snap, fingertip rubbing on paper, paper sliding on tabletop, phone handling rustle, subtle electronics room hum. Make it musically engaging with clear rhythm and forward momentum. 164 BPM, in E major, fast tempo, dense density, 18 seconds long. Instrumental only, no vocals, no lyrics."
