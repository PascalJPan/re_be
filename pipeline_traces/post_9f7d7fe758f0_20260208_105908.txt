{
  "scene_description": "A tight, flat-lit close-up of vertical color bands\u2014blue, lime, hot pink, and green\u2014like sticky notes or a color test strip laid on a desk.

 STEP 4: IMAGE ENHANCEMENT PROMPT (OpenAI → gpt-5.2)
================================================================================

Input: ImageAnalysis + ColorInput + SquiggleFeatures

Output (ImageEnhancementPrompt):
{
  "emotional_intent": "Turn fidgety creative anticipation into a crisp, electric lab-notebook trance\u2014orderly but buzzing with contained energy.",
  "visual_directive": "Recast the paper color bands as a neon cyanotype-risograph hybrid with botanical micro-etching, ink misregistration, and blueprint-style measurement marks in #00ffa5.",
  "morphing_prompt": "Transform the close-up of vertical paper strips into a high-contrast cyanotype blueprint print invaded by vivid risograph layers: push all shadows into deep Prussian blues while blasting highlights into pale paper-white, then overprint the bands with misregistered ink passes in #00ffa5 that bleed at the edges like wet screenprint. Embed fine technical drafting artifacts\u2014gridlines, crop marks, tiny calibration numbers, and halftone dot textures\u2014so the strips feel like a scientific color test gone punk, while keeping the fingertip and the paper texture clearly recognizable. Add controlled geometric warping along the strip borders (slight ripple, edge lift, micro-tears) and a subtle UV-glow fringe on high-contrast edges to make the scene hum like an engineered artifact.",
  "style_reference": "Cyanotype blueprint print + fluorescent risograph poster aesthetics, with Bauhaus calibration graphics and print-shop misregistration"
}

 STEP 5: IMAGE MORPHING (OpenAI → gpt-image-1)
================================================================================

Input image: original + color overlay (Pillow)
Prompt sent to gpt-image-1:

  "Transform the close-up of vertical paper strips into a high-contrast cyanotype blueprint print invaded by vivid risograph layers: push all shadows into deep Prussian blues while blasting highlights into pale paper-white, then overprint the bands with misregistered ink passes in #00ffa5 that bleed at the edges like wet screenprint.

================================================================================

Input: AudioStructuredObject + ColorInput + ImageAnalysis + SquiggleFeatures

Output (prompt string sent to ElevenLabs):

  "Instrumental music track. Genre: hyperpop. Scene: A tight, flat-lit close-up of vertical color bands—blue, lime, hot pink, and green—like sticky notes or a color test strip laid on a desk. The surface reads matte and papery, with shallow depth and a soft shadow at the top where a fingertip intrudes, giving the scene a tactile, handheld immediacy.. Vibe: neon-matte crispness, papery dry brightness, playful synthetic pop, close-quarters tactile immediacy. Setting: null indoor. Sounds like: A bright, staccato synth arpeggio clicking like paper edges being aligned under fluorescent light.. Explosively energetic, playful and restlessly focused mood with a organic and verdant, vivid tonal palette, staccato, clicky, glossy-synthetic, tight-gated, layered arpeggios, micro-percussive textures, and driving, steady rhythms with layered complexity. Instruments: bright analog synth arpeggiator, FM pluck lead, 808 kick, tight clap/snare. Timbre: neon-clean digital brightness with papery clicks, short room reverb, and crisp transient focus. Harmonic feel: sparkly and resolving with quick, curious turnarounds. Dynamic shape: quick drop-in, steady forward push with small rhythmic fills, final bar filter-lift then hard stop. Drawing from: sticky note edge peel snap, fingertip rubbing on paper, paper sliding on tabletop, phone handling rustle, subtle electronics room hum. Make it musically engaging with clear rhythm and forward momentum. 164 BPM, in E major, fast tempo, dense density, 18 seconds long. Instrumental only, no vocals, no lyrics."
