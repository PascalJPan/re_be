  "saturation": 0.624,
  "lightness": 0.5

 STEP 2: IMAGE ANALYSIS (OpenAI Vision → gpt-5.2)
================================================================================

Input: user-uploaded image (binary)

Output (ImageAnalysis):
{
  "scene_description": "A tightly framed, high-contrast portrait fills the space with a stern, forward-facing gaze, lit by cool, clinical highlights that catch on pale hair and textured skin. The background falls into a soft, official blur\u2014suggesting flags and dark wood\u2014creating shallow depth that presses the subject toward the viewer like a spotlighted podium moment.",
  "detected_objects": [
    "human face (close-up portrait)",
    "light blond/gray hair",
    "blue suit jacket",
    "white dress shirt",

  "environment": "indoor",
  "time_of_day": "null",
  "location_hint": "an official government office or formal institutional interior with a U.S. flag nearby",
  "ambient_sound_associations": [
    "low HVAC hum diffused through vents",
    "soft camera shutter clicks and a faint motorized lens whir",
    "distant muffled footsteps on carpeted hallway",
    "a restrained rustle of suit fabric as posture settles",
    "subtle flag fabric whisper from minor air movement",
    "quiet fluorescent ballast buzz under the room tone",
    "a far-off door latch and cushioned thud"
  ],
  "sonic_metaphor": "A single, hard piano note held under fluorescent light, with a thin ribbon of static tightening around it."

 STEP 3: SQUIGGLE FEATURE EXTRACTION
================================================================================

Output (SquiggleFeatures):

================================================================================
 STEP 4: IMAGE ENHANCEMENT PROMPT (OpenAI → gpt-5.2)
================================================================================

Input: ImageAnalysis + ColorInput + SquiggleFeatures

Output (ImageEnhancementPrompt):
{
  "emotional_intent": "Intensify the compressed resolve into a simmering, pressurized authority\u2014controlled on the surface, volatile underneath.",
  "visual_directive": "Grade the image toward warm red undertones with tightened contrast, deeper blacks, and a subtle heat-haze glow that turns the clinical spotlight into a charged, confrontational atmosphere.",
  "morphing_prompt": "Preserve the exact portrait and composition, but shift the lighting from cool, clinical highlights to a warmer, red-leaning key with restrained amber edges, as if the air has heated under scrutiny. Deepen shadows around the jawline, eye sockets, and suit folds; add fine, gritty film grain and micro-contrast to emphasize skin texture and the lacquered formality, while keeping the background flags and wood softly blurred. Introduce a faint vignette and a barely perceptible atmospheric haze that makes the scene feel airless and tense, with highlights slightly blooming like a flashbulb caught in rising pressure.",
  "style_reference": "Political thriller cinematography in the vein of David Fincher (cool precision pushed into heated tension)"
}

================================================================================
 STEP 5: IMAGE MORPHING (OpenAI → gpt-image-1)
================================================================================

Input image: original + color overlay (Pillow)
Prompt sent to gpt-image-1:

  "Preserve the exact portrait and composition, but shift the lighting from cool, clinical highlights to a warmer, red-leaning key with restrained amber edges, as if the air has heated under scrutiny. Deepen shadows around the jawline, eye sockets, and suit folds; add fine, gritty film grain and micro-contrast to emphasize skin texture and the lacquered formality, while keeping the background flags and wood softly blurred.
