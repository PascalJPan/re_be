 STEP 2: IMAGE ANALYSIS (OpenAI Vision → gpt-5.2)
================================================================================

Input: user-uploaded image (binary)

Output (ImageAnalysis):
{
  "scene_description": "A close, studio-lit portrait of a man mid-conversation, hands lifted as if shaping an idea in the air. Cool cyan light skims his face and sweater, while the background falls into a deep, velvety blue gradient that feels like a quiet stage with soft depth and no visible edges.",
  "detected_objects": [
    "person",
    "dark hair",
    "crewneck sweater (knit fabric)",
    "clip-on lavalier microphone",
    "hands in gesturing pose",
    "blurred foreground paper or card",
    "studio backdrop (blue gradient)"
  ],
  "vibe": "cool-toned, velvety-studio hush, electric-cyan clarity, softly pressurized intimacy",
  "emotion": "focused concern threaded with cautious explanation",
  "dominant_colors": [
    "deep midnight blue",
    "teal-cyan wash",
    "cool slate green",
    "soft steel gray",
    "near-black shadow"
  ],
  "environment": "indoor",
  "time_of_day": "null",
  "location_hint": "A studio interview or panel setup with controlled lighting and a seamless backdrop",
  "ambient_sound_associations": [
    "soft fabric rustle from sleeves as hands move",
    "a lavalier mic cable faintly tapping against the sweater",
    "quiet inhale before speaking",
    "low room-tone hum from studio lights or HVAC",
    "paper edge sliding or lightly flicking in the foreground",
    "a muted chair creak under a small shift in posture",
    "distant, subdued murmurs from off-camera crew"
  ],
  "sonic_metaphor": "A thin, steady synth pad under a careful voice\u2014like a question held in the air, vibrating just before it becomes an answer."

 STEP 3: SQUIGGLE FEATURE EXTRACTION
================================================================================

Output (SquiggleFeatures):

  "point_count": 57
}

================================================================================
 STEP 4: IMAGE ENHANCEMENT PROMPT (OpenAI → gpt-5.2)
================================================================================

Input: ImageAnalysis + ColorInput + SquiggleFeatures

Output (ImageEnhancementPrompt):
{
  "emotional_intent": "Transform the calm, focused portrait into a surreal, glitch-infused digital reverie that disorients and engages the viewer's perception.",
  "visual_directive": "Dissolve the image into a fractured cyber-noir mosaic with chromatic aberration, pixel glitches, and distorted geometric shards.",
  "morphing_prompt": "Create a striking collage of the portrait rendered as a chaotic, glitch-stained digital mosaic. Incorporate harsh, jagged fragments, vibrant neon cyan and midnight blue distortions, and layered pixel noise. Add faint double exposure textures and neon grid overlays to evoke a hyper-modern, dystopian aesthetic, while keeping the subject's face and hands recognizable amid the fragmentation.",
  "style_reference": "Cyberpunk manga panel"
}

================================================================================
 STEP 5: IMAGE MORPHING (OpenAI → gpt-image-1)
================================================================================

Input image: original + color overlay (Pillow)
Prompt sent to gpt-image-1:

  "Create a striking collage of the portrait rendered as a chaotic, glitch-stained digital mosaic. Incorporate harsh, jagged fragments, vibrant neon cyan and midnight blue distortions, and layered pixel noise. Add faint double exposure textures and neon grid overlays to evoke a hyper-modern, dystopian aesthetic, while keeping the subject's face and hands recognizable amid the fragmentation."

Output: morphed image bytes (stored as post image) — SUCCESS

 STEP 7: COMPILED PROMPT (deterministic logic)
================================================================================

Input: AudioStructuredObject + ColorInput + ImageAnalysis + SquiggleFeatures

Output (prompt string sent to ElevenLabs):

  "Instrumental ambient track. Genre: ambient. Scene: A close, studio-lit portrait of a man mid-conversation, hands lifted as if shaping an idea in the air. Cool cyan light skims his face and sweater, while the background falls into a deep, velvety blue gradient that feels like a quiet stage with soft depth and no visible edges.. Vibe: cool-toned, velvety-studio hush, electric-cyan clarity, softly pressurized intimacy. Setting: null indoor. Sounds like: A thin, steady synth pad under a careful voice—like a question held in the air, vibrating just before it becomes an answer.. Building momentum, focused and intimate mood with a crisp and spacious, vivid tonal palette, smooth, minimal, velvety textures, and flowing, melodic phrases. Instruments: digital pad, subtle field recordings. Timbre: cool, digital, muted textures. Harmonic feel: suspending. Dynamic shape: slow and steady with gentle fluctuations. Drawing from: studio ambiance, soft fabric rustle, faint mic cable tap, low hum, subdued murmurs. Make it musically engaging with clear rhythm and forward momentum. 90 BPM, in E minor, slow tempo, medium density, 18 seconds long. Instrumental only, no vocals, no lyrics."
