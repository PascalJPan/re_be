 STEP 2: IMAGE ANALYSIS (OpenAI Vision → gpt-5.2)
================================================================================

Input: user-uploaded image (binary)

Output (ImageAnalysis):
{
  "scene_description": "A softly lit, slightly grainy indoor room stretches back under a grid of fluorescent ceiling tiles, creating a shallow, office-like depth that fades into gray. In the foreground, a person in a gray hoodie leans toward the camera with a squinting, tired focus, while the background recedes to a dim figure seated near a pale wall. The light feels cool and flat, with muted shadows that make the space sound like it has hard surfaces and a faint electronic hum.",

 STEP 4: IMAGE ENHANCEMENT PROMPT (OpenAI → gpt-5.2)
================================================================================

Input: ImageAnalysis + ColorInput + SquiggleFeatures

Output (ImageEnhancementPrompt):
{
  "emotional_intent": "Amplify the weary curiosity into a lucid, late-night fluorescent trance\u2014quietly tense, intimate, and slightly unreal.",
  "visual_directive": "Grade the scene toward high-saturation cool cyan with deeper blacks, crisp fluorescent highlights, and a thin veil of atmospheric haze to make the air feel electrically charged.",
  "morphing_prompt": "Keep the exact composition and subjects, but push the room into a cyan-leaning, after-hours mood: cool the whites into icy blue, deepen the charcoal tones, and let the fluorescent panels bloom with a soft, clinical glow. Enhance the existing grain into a finer, more tactile film texture, adding subtle halation around highlights and a gentle vignette that pulls attention to the hoodie figure\u2019s face. Introduce a faint, low-energy haze and micro-contrast in the ceiling grid so the space feels like it\u2019s humming\u2014still, muffled, and slightly surreal\u2014without changing any objects or layout.",
  "style_reference": "Neo-noir fluorescent realism with a subtle Gregory Crewdson suburban uncanny tone"
}

================================================================================
 STEP 5: IMAGE MORPHING (OpenAI → gpt-image-1)
================================================================================

Input image: original + color overlay (Pillow)
Prompt sent to gpt-image-1:

  "Keep the exact composition and subjects, but push the room into a cyan-leaning, after-hours mood: cool the whites into icy blue, deepen the charcoal tones, and let the fluorescent panels bloom with a soft, clinical glow. Enhance the existing grain into a finer, more tactile film texture, adding subtle halation around highlights and a gentle vignette that pulls attention to the hoodie figure’s face. Introduce a faint, low-energy haze and micro-contrast in the ceiling grid so the space feels like it’s humming—still, muffled, and slightly surreal—without changing any objects or layout."
