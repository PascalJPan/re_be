Output (prompt string sent to ElevenLabs):

  "Instrumental music track. Genre: minimal glitch-hop. Scene: A close, slightly grainy selfie in a fluorescent-lit room: a young man in the foreground smiles softly while a second figure sits deeper in the frame, partially obscured. The ceiling grid and long ventilation strip recede overhead, giving the space a cool, office-like depth, while a large thumbs-up fills the right side like a warm, fleshy foreground drumbeat against the sterile light.. Vibe: cool fluorescent sterility, soft-grain casualness, airy institutional quiet, playful foreground immediacy. Setting: null indoor. Sounds like: A bright, steady electrical hum with a single friendly handclap echoing softly in a tiled room.. Quietly building, tentative-optimistic and self-conscious-camaraderie mood with a warm and lush tonal palette, Instruments: Rhodes piano (muted), digital pad (glassy, cool), 808 kick (soft, rounded), rimshot/snare (tight, dry). Timbre: cool fluorescent air and crystalline digital sheen warmed by magenta-tinted midrange and cassette grain. Harmonic feel: suspended with a warm-leaning lift.

Drawing from: fluorescent ballast buzz layered as a sustained synth tone, soft HVAC airflow as a noise bed, muffled hallway footsteps as distant low-passed thumps, chair-leg scrape as a single reversed swell accent, subtle phone-handling click as a one-shot transient. 108 BPM, in D minor, medium tempo, sparse density, 18 seconds long.
