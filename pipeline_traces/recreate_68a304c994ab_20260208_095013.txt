================================================================================

Input: user-uploaded image (binary)

Output (ImageAnalysis):
{
  "scene_description": "A pair of rust-brown rails runs straight into a vanishing point, swallowed by a tunnel of dense, wet-green foliage.

 STEP 4: IMAGE ENHANCEMENT PROMPT (OpenAI → gpt-5.2)
================================================================================

Input: ImageAnalysis + ColorInput + SquiggleFeatures

Output (ImageEnhancementPrompt):
{
  "emotional_intent": "Turn the quiet suspense of abandonment into a botanical omen\u2014calm on the surface, secretly alive and watching.",
  "visual_directive": "Recast the scene as a vintage field-guide risograph print with toxic-cool green ink, tactile paper grain, and controlled graphic simplification.",
  "morphing_prompt": "Transform the overgrown railway corridor into a bold risograph + botanical-plate hybrid: flatten the foliage into layered ink shapes in #43bc64 and deep olive, with misregistered passes, halftone dot gradients, and visible paper fibers. Keep the rails and sleepers sharply recognizable but render them as crisp woodcut-like lines and stippled shadow blocks, pushing the vanishing point into a pale, overprinted green haze. Concentrate the most dramatic texture and ink density along the central track bed (a focused, controlled effect), letting the outer foliage fall into calmer, cleaner silhouettes with subtle ink bleed at the edges.",
  "style_reference": "Vintage botanical field guide meets modern risograph poster print (misregistration, halftone dots, paper grain)"
}

================================================================================
 STEP 5: IMAGE MORPHING (OpenAI → gpt-image-1)
================================================================================

Input image: original + color overlay (Pillow)
Prompt sent to gpt-image-1:

 STEP 7: COMPILED PROMPT (deterministic logic)
================================================================================

Input: AudioStructuredObject + ColorInput + ImageAnalysis + SquiggleFeatures

Output (prompt string sent to ElevenLabs):

  "Instrumental music track. Genre: cinematic post-rock. Scene: A pair of rust-brown rails runs straight into a vanishing point, swallowed by a tunnel of dense, wet-green foliage. The light is filtered and cool, pooling softly at the far end like a pale opening, while the foreground feels close and textured—splintered ties, scattered leaves, and creeping plants reclaiming the track bed.. Vibe: chlorophyll-drenched hush, damp velvety shade, feral overgrowth, cool filtered stillness. Setting: afternoon outdoor. Sounds like: A long, damp reverb of green—like a single muted guitar harmonic stretched down an empty tunnel and slowly swallowed by insects.. Driving and pulsing, suspenseful and nostalgic mood with a organic and verdant tonal palette, damp cavern reverb, soft pulsing drone, delicate harmonic plucks, subtle granular insect-like shimmer textures, and sustained pads and slow drones with focused simplicity. Instruments: clean electric guitar harmonics, analog synth pad, sub bass, brushy kick/snare (very light). Timbre: cool-green, wet and shadowy; clean transients with long damp reverb and subtle tape haze. Harmonic feel: suspended and uneasy, slowly resolving. Dynamic shape: near-still opening with a slow swell of drone and pulse, then a gentle fade into reverb tail. Drawing from: insects ticking and droning in the undergrowth, leaves whispering in a light breeze, faint water drip from leaves after rain, a vine lightly scraping metal rail. Make it musically engaging with clear rhythm and forward momentum. 92 BPM, in D minor, slow tempo, sparse density, 18 seconds long. Instrumental only, no vocals, no lyrics."
